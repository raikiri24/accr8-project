STRUGGLES:

1.  MANIPULATING OBJECTS (Comparing object values)
    ![manipulating objects](manipulating_object.png "Manipulating Object")
2.  Due to manipulation of object problem I hacked JSON and added an array for sold objects, sales_per_month. (I'm Still working on the algo for the object comparisons)

3.  I've downloaded a template for the UI but I will convert it to react component and remove all the assets later. Then install the package of the given CSS framework. (I used my own CSS for other components)
